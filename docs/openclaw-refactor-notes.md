# OpenClaw Refactor Notes

AgentOS now has a clearer OpenClaw boundary:

- AgentOS UI/API routes call `lib/agentos/control-plane.ts`.
- The control plane calls `lib/openclaw/application/*` services.
- Application services use `OpenClawAdapter` where gateway behavior is needed.
- `OpenClawAdapter` delegates transport work to `OpenClawGatewayClient`.
- `NativeWsOpenClawGatewayClient` handles confirmed request/response Gateway RPC calls and now attempts Gateway-first typed reads/probes where response shapes can be safely normalized.
- `CliOpenClawGatewayClient` remains the complete fallback implementation.
- `lib/openclaw/service.ts` remains as a compatibility/delegation layer for older imports.

Reference docs inspected during this continuation:

- https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/gateway
- https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/rpc

## Moved In This Continuation

`lib/openclaw/client/native-ws-gateway-client.ts` was added and later expanded:

- Implements the confirmed Gateway frame shape used by the OpenClaw control UI: `type: "req"` requests and `type: "res"` responses.
- Performs a protocol v3 `connect` handshake before method calls.
- Correlates request ids to responses.
- Handles native timeout, abort, close, and error cleanup.
- Normalizes Gateway error payloads before falling back.
- Supports native WS for generic `call(method, params)`.
- Attempts Gateway-first typed reads/probes for status, gateway status/probe, model status/list/scan, skills, plugins, agents list, sessions list, and config get.
- If native `status` omits update registry data, it backfills only `update.registry.latestVersion`/`error` from the CLI status payload and caches the discovered registry slice so update visibility stays accurate while the rest of the snapshot remains Gateway-first.
- Attempts Gateway-first config set/unset through config snapshot mutation when Gateway exposes a usable config hash.
- Validates Gateway payloads at the client boundary and falls back to CLI on malformed required fields.
- Records recent Gateway-first fallback diagnostics for mission-control diagnostics.
- Keeps agent mutation, gateway control, provisioning, and streaming methods on the CLI fallback.

`lib/openclaw/client/gateway-client-factory.ts` now creates a native-first client wrapper unless CLI fallback is forced.

CLI fallback can be forced with either:

- `AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_CLIENT=cli`
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_CLIENT=cli`
- `AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_NATIVE_WS=0|false|off`

Native WS connection settings:

- `AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`
- `AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
- `AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`
- `AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_NATIVE_WS_TIMEOUT_MS`

`lib/openclaw/adapter/openclaw-adapter.ts` was expanded into the AgentOS-facing boundary for:

- Status: `getStatus`, `getGatewayStatus`, `getModelStatus`
- Gateway control: `controlGateway`, `probeGateway`
- Catalog: `listModels`, `scanModels`, `listSkills`, `listPlugins`
- Config: `getConfig`, `setConfig`, `unsetConfig`
- Agent/session reads: `listAgents`, `listSessions`
- Agents/runs: `addAgent`, `deleteAgent`, `runAgentTurn`, `streamAgentTurn`
- Generic Gateway RPC: `call`

Application call sites moved from direct gateway-client usage to the adapter:

- `lib/openclaw/application/catalog-service.ts`
- `lib/openclaw/application/agent-service.ts`
- `app/api/agents/[agentId]/chat/route.ts`
- Remaining compatibility code in `lib/openclaw/service.ts` now uses the adapter for gateway-backed config, agent delete, and stream turn calls instead of importing the gateway client directly.

`lib/openclaw/application/runtime-service.ts` now owns:

- `getRuntimeOutput`
- `getTaskDetail`
- `ensureOpenClawRuntimeStateAccess`
- `touchOpenClawRuntimeStateAccess`
- `ensureOpenClawRuntimeSmokeTest`

`lib/openclaw/application/mission-service.ts` now owns:

- `submitMission`
- `abortMissionTask`

`lib/openclaw/application/settings-service.ts` now owns:

- `updateGatewayRemoteUrl`
- `updateWorkspaceRoot`

`lib/openclaw/application/workspace-service.ts` now owns the workspace mutation slice:

- `createWorkspaceProject`
- `updateWorkspaceProject`
- `deleteWorkspaceProject`
- Existing workspace reuse and manifest-agent repair for create.
- Workspace source materialization and scaffold writing for create.
- Bootstrapped workspace agent provisioning for create.
- Workspace kickoff mission dispatch for create.
- Create-time agent policy skill sync, snapshot invalidation, and runtime history clearing.
- Workspace rename/relocation and agent config path rewrite.
- Workspace plan edit application, manifest rewrite, doc override handling, and agent sync.
- Workspace delete cleanup for OpenClaw agents, agent config entries, workspace files, and runtime counts.

`lib/openclaw/service.ts` keeps the workspace compatibility exports but now delegates create/update/delete to `workspace-service`.

`lib/openclaw/application/channel-service.ts` now owns the channel registry mutation slice:

- `upsertWorkspaceChannel`
- `disconnectWorkspaceChannel`
- `deleteWorkspaceChannelEverywhere`
- `setWorkspaceChannelPrimary`
- `setWorkspaceChannelGroups`
- `bindWorkspaceChannelAgent`
- `unbindWorkspaceChannelAgent`
- Managed routing sync for bindings, Telegram group config, Discord guild config, Telegram session store reconciliation, and Telegram coordination policy skill sync.
- Managed channel/surface account provisioning for Telegram, Discord, Slack, Google Chat, Gmail, webhook, cron, and email surfaces.
- Telegram account resolution helpers, managed surface config normalization, Gmail setup argument building, and CLI fallback provisioning calls.

`lib/openclaw/service.ts` keeps the channel compatibility exports but now delegates channel registry mutation and managed provisioning workflows to `channel-service`.

`lib/openclaw/service.ts` delegates those moved functions to application services and remains the compatibility layer.

## Native WS Support Status

Native WS remains intentionally scoped, but read/probe workflows are now Gateway-first where this codebase has safe response normalization.

Supported natively:

- Handshake with the Gateway `connect` RPC.
- Generic request/response RPC calls through `call(method, params)`.
- Gateway-first typed reads and support methods for `health`, `status`, `models.authStatus`, `models.list`, `channels.status`, `skills.status`, `plugins.uiDescriptors`, `agents.list`, `sessions.list`, `config.get`, `logs.tail`, `exec.approval.*`, and `cron.*`.
- Gateway-first agent lifecycle through `agents.create`, `agents.update`, and `agents.delete`, with AgentOS-owned metadata side effects preserved around those calls.
- Gateway-first mission dispatch/abort through `chat.send` / `sessions.send` and `sessions.abort` / `chat.abort`, plus native stream adapter support through session event subscriptions. Direct chat still uses CLI transcript fallback when Gateway events omit assistant text.
- Gateway-first `config.set`/`config.unset` by reading the Gateway config snapshot, probing `config.schema.lookup` / `config.schema`, applying a path-level merge patch through `config.patch` with the Gateway base hash, and using `config.apply` only when patch is unavailable.
- Request id correlation.
- Timeout and abort cleanup.
- Error normalization, typed failure classification, malformed payload handling, conservative auth discovery, redacted-secret protection, and fallback to CLI.

Still CLI-backed by design:

- agent lifecycle fallback when `agents.create` / `agents.update` / `agents.delete` are unsupported
- streamed agent turns when Gateway event subscriptions are unavailable
- gateway start/stop/restart

Reason: Gateway methods now cover the lifecycle and streaming entry points, but AgentOS still owns metadata, policy skill, bootstrap, workspace manifest, transcript, and compatibility side effects around those native calls.

## Fallback Behavior

Fallback is preserved at every layer:

- The factory returns `NativeWsOpenClawGatewayClient` with `CliOpenClawGatewayClient` as fallback.
- If native WS is disabled, unavailable, times out, fails handshake, closes, returns an error, or returns malformed typed payloads, supported Gateway-first calls fall back to CLI.
- If OpenClaw only exposes a redacted config secret to AgentOS, native WS records an auth diagnostic and falls back to CLI instead of sending the redacted placeholder as a token.
- Unsupported mutation/streaming typed methods on the native client delegate directly to CLI.
- Settings/config now attempt Gateway snapshot mutation first and fall back to the CLI path mutation when Gateway is unavailable, scope-limited, malformed, or missing a usable base hash.

`lib/openclaw/client/gateway-client-factory.ts` now exposes `setOpenClawGatewayClientProvider(provider)` as the future SDK replacement point. A future `SdkOpenClawGatewayClient` should implement `OpenClawGatewayClient` and be installed through the factory without changing application services, routes, or UI code.

## Still In `service.ts`

`lib/openclaw/service.ts` is now an intentionally retained legacy compatibility/delegation entrypoint. Decision: keep the public compatibility surface for now, block new production imports, and require a deliberate compatibility audit before removing any export.

Remaining exports are classified as:

- Compatibility delegates:
  - Mission control: `clearMissionControlCaches`, `getMissionControlSnapshot`
  - Runtime reads/smoke checks: `ensureOpenClawRuntimeStateAccess`, `touchOpenClawRuntimeStateAccess`, `ensureOpenClawRuntimeSmokeTest`, `getRuntimeOutput`, `getTaskDetail`
  - Mission workflows: `submitMission`, `abortMissionTask`
  - Agent workflows: `createAgent`, `updateAgent`, `deleteAgent`
  - Workspace workflows: `createWorkspaceProject`, `updateWorkspaceProject`, `deleteWorkspaceProject`, `readWorkspaceEditSeed`
  - Settings workflows: `updateGatewayRemoteUrl`, `updateWorkspaceRoot`
  - Channel workflows: `upsertWorkspaceChannel`, `disconnectWorkspaceChannel`, `deleteWorkspaceChannelEverywhere`, `setWorkspaceChannelPrimary`, `setWorkspaceChannelGroups`, `bindWorkspaceChannelAgent`, `unbindWorkspaceChannelAgent`
  - Managed provisioning: `createManagedChatChannelAccount`, `createManagedSurfaceAccount`, `createTelegramChannelAccount`
  - Discovery/model/session re-exports: `discoverDiscordRoutes`, `discoverSurfaceRoutes`, `discoverTelegramGroups`, `getChannelRegistry`, `inferSessionKindFromCatalogEntry`, `inferFallbackModelMetadata`
- Legacy workspace document render helper compatibility delegates:
  - `renderAgentsMarkdown`, `renderSoulMarkdown`, `renderIdentityMarkdown`, `renderToolsMarkdown`, `renderHeartbeatMarkdown`, `renderMemoryMarkdown`, `renderBlueprintMarkdown`, `renderDecisionsMarkdown`, `renderBriefMarkdown`, `renderArchitectureMarkdown`, `renderDeliverablesMarkdown`, `renderTemplateSpecificDoc`
- Shared helpers still used by production:
  - None directly implemented in `service.ts`.
- Dead/unused exports:
  - None removed in this pass. The previously local, unused bootstrap-agent-id helper block in `service.ts` was removed because the real production implementation already lives in `lib/openclaw/domains/agent-provisioning.ts` and `workspace-service.ts`.

Legacy workspace document render helper implementation moved to `lib/openclaw/domains/workspace-document-renderers.ts`. `service.ts` still exports the same helper names and delegates to that domain module to preserve compatibility.

Direct production imports from `lib/openclaw/service.ts`: none found. Current imports are compatibility tests only:

- `tests/openclaw-application-service-compat.test.ts`
- `tests/openclaw-agent-service.test.ts`
- `tests/openclaw-channel-service.test.ts`
- `tests/openclaw-import-guard.test.ts` uses a synthetic import string to verify the guard.
- `tests/openclaw-mission-control-service.test.ts`
- `tests/openclaw-service-surface.test.ts`
- `tests/openclaw-workspace-service.test.ts`

Import guard status: `eslint.config.mjs` now blocks production TS/TSX imports of `@/lib/openclaw/service` and relative OpenClaw service imports. Tests remain allowed so compatibility coverage can keep exercising the legacy entrypoint. The guard is covered by tests that verify production imports fail once and compatibility test imports remain allowed.

Production-safety scans:

- No `lib/openclaw` import cycles were detected by a lightweight local import graph scan.
- No production direct imports from `lib/openclaw/service.ts` were found.
- Direct `runOpenClawJson` remains in `lib/openclaw/cli.ts`, which defines the CLI JSON helper.
- Direct `runOpenClawJson` remains in `lib/openclaw/client/cli-gateway-client.ts`, which is the intended CLI fallback layer.
- Direct `runOpenClawJson` also remains in `lib/openclaw/domains/agent-config.ts`, `lib/openclaw/domains/channels.ts`, `lib/openclaw/surface-adapters.ts`, and the legacy planner runtime path in `lib/openclaw/planner.ts`. These are existing config/discovery/planner readers for OpenClaw state or legacy runtime execution paths that have not yet been given stable Gateway RPC equivalents. They are intentionally left unchanged in this stabilization pass to preserve fallback behavior and response shapes.
- Direct `runOpenClaw` remains in `lib/openclaw/client/cli-gateway-client.ts`, `lib/openclaw/application/channel-service.ts`, `lib/openclaw/domains/agent-config.ts`, `lib/openclaw/domains/agent-provisioning.ts`, `lib/openclaw/planner.ts`, and `lib/openclaw/reset.ts`. These are still intentional CLI-backed fallback, provisioning, config sync, planner, and reset workflows until equivalent OpenClaw protocol support is confirmed.
- `hasGatewayRemoteUrlConfig` was removed from `lib/openclaw/domains/control-plane-settings.ts`; gateway remote URL existence checks now go through `OpenClawAdapter.hasConfig`, backed by the Gateway-first client with CLI fallback.

## Prompt And Codebase Conflicts

- The prompt asked for Gateway-first behavior. The codebase and local OpenClaw artifacts confirm safe request/response Gateway RPC for reads/probes, config snapshot mutation, agent lifecycle, mission dispatch, and native stream adapter support. Decision: make supported workflows Gateway-first and keep CLI/application fallback for unsupported, incomplete, or failed workflows.
- Workspace mutation and channel/provisioning were moved incrementally with compatibility tests and CLI fallback preserved.
- A no-restricted-imports guard is now active for production code. Compatibility tests still intentionally import `lib/openclaw/service.ts`.

## Tests

Latest verification:

- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm lint` passed with 0 warnings.
- `pnpm test` passed: 105 tests.

Runtime production-readiness follow-up:

- Workspace creation now returns the same path-derived slug id used by mission-control snapshots and `/api/workspaces`.
- Workspace update/delete and agent workspace resolution still accept the previous `workspace:<hash>` id as a legacy alias so older compatibility callers do not fail immediately.
- Runtime session normalization now uses the same workspace id helper, keeping task/runtime workspace links aligned with snapshot workspace ids.
- This fixes the observed create flow where a newly created workspace selected an id that did not exist in the refreshed snapshot, leaving the canvas empty until a page reload.
- Same-basename workspace paths are now disambiguated with a short path hash only when a collision is present, preserving normal slug ids for non-colliding workspaces.
- Mission-control snapshots now read `gateway.remote.url` through the adapter so gateway remote URL set/clear mutations are reflected in `diagnostics.configuredGatewayUrl`.

Added/updated coverage:

- Native WS handshake success.
- Gateway-first typed status request usage.
- Gateway-first typed agent list and session list usage.
- Gateway-first config path reads and config path mutation through Gateway snapshots.
- Gateway client factory provider extension point for a future SDK-backed client.
- Gateway auth discovery for local and remote Gateway URLs.
- Redacted OpenClaw config secrets are not sent over native WS.
- Recovered Gateway operations clear stale fallback diagnostics.
- Gateway malformed typed response fallback to CLI.
- Gateway failure plus CLI fallback failure returns the actionable CLI failure while retaining Gateway fallback diagnostics.
- Native WS handshake failure fallback to CLI.
- Native WS timeout fallback to CLI.
- Expanded adapter methods through `setOpenClawGatewayClientForTesting`.
- Adapter/client coverage for `hasConfig`, used by settings-service to avoid direct CLI config existence checks in the domain layer.
- Runtime-service compatibility for missing runtime and missing task shapes.
- Mission-service compatibility for submit validation and missing-task abort shape.
- Settings-service compatibility for gateway URL and workspace root validation shapes.
- Workspace-service compatibility for workspace create/update/delete validation shapes.
- Workspace id compatibility for current snapshot ids, same-basename collision disambiguation, and legacy hash aliases.
- Workspace document render helper compatibility delegates.
- Channel-service compatibility for registry mutation validation and missing-channel shapes.
- Channel-service compatibility for managed provisioning validation shapes across chat and surface providers.
- Additional channel-service compatibility for direct managed chat provisioning validation shapes across Telegram, Discord, Slack, and Google Chat.
- Import guard coverage for blocking production `service.ts` imports without duplicate lint noise while allowing compatibility tests.
- Boundary safety coverage for production `service.ts` imports, app/component/hook low-level CLI/raw Gateway imports, allowlisted direct `runOpenClawJson` usage, allowlisted direct `runOpenClaw` usage, and `lib/openclaw` import cycles.
- Compatibility surface coverage that keeps the explicit `service.ts` export list from changing accidentally.

Native WS status: Gateway-first for supported typed read/probe workflows, config snapshot mutation, agent lifecycle, mission dispatch, stream adapter support, logs, approvals, cron reads, and generic RPC when usable native auth is available; CLI-backed for gateway process control, provisioning, unsupported older Gateway versions, direct-chat transcript compatibility fallback, and environments where OpenClaw exposes only redacted secrets to AgentOS. CLI fallback status is unchanged and remains required for production safety.

Current risks:

- `service.ts` is still part of the public compatibility surface, so removing any export requires a separate caller audit and migration.
- Workspace document rendering now has a dedicated legacy renderer module for compatibility, while `workspace-docs.ts` continues to own richer scaffold rendering used by production workspace creation. These are intentionally not merged in this pass to avoid changing scaffold output.
- Some domain/application workflows still call the OpenClaw CLI directly because no stable native Gateway method mapping is confirmed for those mutation/provisioning operations.
- Channel-service remains broad. No additional split was made because the current helper groups are coupled to routing sync, account discovery, and provisioning side effects.
- Real runtime model completion was blocked during smoke testing by local ChatGPT/OpenClaw usage limits; API streaming and stalled-state handling were validated, but a successful model-completion demo still needs available quota or another configured provider.

## Next Safe Migrations

Recommended next order:

1. Keep the import guard in place and migrate any future production caller to the owning application/domain module instead of `service.ts`.
2. If the compatibility render helpers are still needed by external callers, keep them delegated through `service.ts`; otherwise remove them in a separate breaking-surface audit.
3. When OpenClaw exposes confirmed Gateway RPC equivalents for channel/config discovery and provisioning, move those remaining direct CLI-backed domain/application calls behind the adapter/client boundary.
