# OpenClaw Runtime Smoke Test

Date: 2026-05-02

Commit tested: `4b71278` plus the working-tree fixes from this pass.

Latest production-readiness validation update: 2026-05-03.

2026-05-18 Gateway-native readiness update:

- `node scripts/openclaw-runtime-smoke.mjs` is the non-destructive runtime smoke entrypoint for Gateway-native transport checks.
- The script checks Gateway health/status, model status, agents, sessions/recent activity, the Gateway capability matrix, fallback diagnostics, channel/provider status, runtime event subscription readiness, and forced CLI snapshot compatibility.
- A clean run may report `gateway fallback diagnostics` as `PASS` with zero fallback records. Fallback diagnostics are considered a signal to inspect, not a prerequisite for success.
- Runtime event subscription may be `BLOCKED` when a real Gateway is unavailable, auth is missing, scopes are insufficient, or the installed OpenClaw build does not advertise compatible events.

2026-06-02 post-0.6.1 integration smoke strategy:

- Run the automated quality gates first: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typegen`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm check:release`, and `pnpm smoke:agentos-package`.
- Use Node.js 24 or newer for every local, CI, release, and package-manager smoke run.
- Install or select the OpenClaw supported baseline from `lib/openclaw/versions.ts`, start its Gateway on loopback, and verify `openclaw gateway status --json` reports protocol v4, operator auth, and approved operator scopes.
- Run `agentos doctor` before starting the UI. It should report install/runtime basics without deep compatibility noise.
- Run `agentos doctor --deep` before starting the UI. It should report OpenClaw version, Gateway protocol, required method discovery, scopes, config access, channel status, model readiness, fallback count, and last native failure. Fallback count and last native failure may be disabled until AgentOS is running.
- Start AgentOS from the packaged CLI or a clean source checkout, then compare `agentos doctor --deep`, `/api/diagnostics`, and the in-app diagnostics panel for protocol, version, method drift, scopes, fallback count, and last native failure.
- Run `AGENTOS_SMOKE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 node scripts/openclaw-runtime-smoke.mjs` after the UI is reachable.
- Exercise a real mission flow: load snapshot, select or create a workspace-backed agent, dispatch a mission, abort one active run, send a direct chat message, refresh `/api/snapshot?force=true`, and confirm runtime cards show source/degraded state without inventing success from sidecar state.
- Exercise explicit degradation: forced CLI mode, Gateway unavailable, bad token, missing scope approval, and redacted config secret scenarios. CLI fallback must be visible in diagnostics and must not hide unsafe mutations.
- Exercise surface reconcile safely: run a dry-run preview first, inspect the generated `.mission-control/surface-reconcile/*.json` audit record and restore plan, then apply repair only to managed bindings. Unmanaged OpenClaw bindings must remain untouched.
- Keep this smoke manual or environment-gated. It should not be a required CI job because it depends on a local OpenClaw Gateway, operator auth, model availability, and external provider credentials.

Environment:

- AgentOS dev server was already running from `pnpm dev` on `http://localhost:3000`.
- OpenClaw CLI was installed and detected.
- Local gateway endpoint was `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`.
- Browser validation used Browser Use with the in-app browser backend.
- Real Telegram, Discord, Slack, Google Chat, Gmail, webhook, cron, and email credentials were not provided, so provider success flows were not attempted.
- The local OpenClaw ChatGPT account hit a usage limit during agent chat/mission execution, so model-completion success is blocked by account quota.

2026-05-03 update:

- OpenClaw CLI `2026.4.2` was installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/openclaw`.
- Local Gateway LaunchAgent was running on `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` with `rpc.ok: true`.
- The dev server was already running on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Native WS successful-auth validation was blocked because OpenClaw returns `gateway.auth.token` as `__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__` and no real token/password env value was provided.

## Commands Run

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm test -- tests/openclaw-workspace-service.test.ts tests/openclaw-stabilization.test.ts`
- `/bin/zsh -lc "node /private/tmp/agentos-deep-runtime-smoke.mjs"`
- `node scripts/openclaw-runtime-smoke.mjs`
- `openclaw gateway status --json`
- `openclaw gateway stop`
- `openclaw gateway start`
- Fresh-install snapshot simulation with temporary `HOME` and restricted `PATH`
- Native WS auth probes with no token and with an invalid token
- Real agent chat stream through `POST /api/agents/main/chat`
- `/bin/zsh -lc "AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_CLIENT=cli OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_CLIENT=cli AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_NATIVE_WS=0 node -r ./tests/register-paths.cjs -r jiti/register.js -e ..."`
- Browser Use navigation and DOM checks against `http://localhost:3000`.

## Browser Validation

Browser Use was available and used.

Validated:

- AgentOS booted at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Page title was `AgentOS | Control Plane`.
- Initial page contained OpenClaw status, workspace navigation, agent controls, and no captured browser console errors.
- API-created smoke workspaces appeared in the workspace list without a page reload.
- Selecting the non-ASCII smoke workspace `İstanbul Çalışma mooa18rv-yvxl6e` rendered a non-empty workspace canvas with workspace path, agent card, composer, and task controls.
- The previous empty-canvas-after-create symptom is resolved for the smoke workspace id path.

Not fully browser-driven:

- The full workspace wizard submit flow was not completed through browser clicks in this pass. API-level create/update/read flows were executed, then Browser Use validated that the resulting workspace list and canvas state rendered correctly.
- Agent delete and workspace delete through UI were not executed because local deletion requires explicit action-time confirmation.

## Smoke Checklist

Passed:

- App boot and visible Mission Control shell.
- No production imports from `lib/openclaw/service.ts`.
- Existing boundary tests for OpenClaw import cycles and direct CLI usage.
- Gateway restart/start/stop API requests returned stable responses.
- Model catalog loaded with 364 models.
- OpenAI Codex provider status returned a stable configured-model response.
- Model discovery returned 9 models.
- Capability catalog loaded with 14 skills and 37 tools.
- Workspace create returned an id present in refreshed `/api/snapshot?force=true`.
- Workspace edit draft loaded for the created workspace.
- Legacy `workspace:<hash>` update alias worked.
- Additional agent create/update worked in the smoke workspace.
- Non-ASCII workspace name creation worked.
- Same-basename workspace paths were disambiguated: `shared-base` and `shared-base-9c64e76b`.
- Task detail stream emitted a task event.
- Runtime output loaded for the smoke runtime.
- Gateway remote URL set/clear now reflects in `snapshot.diagnostics.configuredGatewayUrl`.
- Invalid gateway protocol `http://example.com` returns HTTP 400 with `Gateway address must start with ws:// or wss://.`
- CLI-forced fallback snapshot loaded with `AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_CLIENT=cli`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_CLIENT=cli`, and `AGENTOS_OPENCLAW_NATIVE_WS=0`.
- Added repository smoke script passed for gateway health/status, model status, agents list, sessions/recent activity, agent preflight, and forced CLI fallback snapshot.
- Fresh-install/no-gateway simulation returned fallback mode with `installed=false`, `loaded=false`, `rpcOk=false`, `health=offline`, and no workspaces or agents.
- Native WS with only redacted OpenClaw config secrets returned a Gateway-first auth diagnostic and then used CLI fallback successfully.
- Native WS with an invalid env token returned an `auth` diagnostic for token mismatch and then used CLI fallback successfully.
- Real agent chat stream completed through `/api/agents/main/chat` and returned `AgentOS runtime smoke ok`.
- The resulting chat session appeared in the refreshed snapshot as a completed runtime for `main`.
- Provider validation returned stable missing-field errors for Telegram, Discord, Slack, Gmail, webhook, cron, and email.
- Google Chat provisioning returned the unsupported-provider error expected for the supported OpenClaw baseline.
- Telegram and Discord route discovery without credentials returned empty routes without crashing.
- Slack discovery is reported unsupported and does not crash.

Blocked:

- Native WS successful-auth path requires a real Gateway token/password through env or explicit client options; OpenClaw config only exposed a redacted placeholder in this environment.
- Real mission completion was not rerun in the 2026-05-03 production-readiness pass because the latest request focused on validation, not creating another mission artifact. Earlier submit/task/runtime surfaces worked, with model quota blocking completion at that time.
- Real provider success flows for Telegram, Discord, Slack, Google Chat, Gmail, webhook, cron, and email require credentials/configuration not present in this environment.
- Actual delete-agent/delete-workspace cleanup is blocked until action-time confirmation is provided for deleting the temporary local smoke artifacts.
- Running a second `next dev` server with forced CLI fallback is blocked by Next dev's single-repo lock while the active dev server is running. A CLI-forced snapshot load was validated instead.

Temporary artifacts pending delete confirmation:

- `runtime-smoke-updated-mooa18rv-yvxl6e` at `/private/tmp/agentos-smoke-mooa18rv-yvxl6e/runtime-smoke-updated-mooa18rv-yvxl6e`
- `istanbul` at `/private/tmp/agentos-smoke-mooa18rv-yvxl6e/istanbul`
- `shared-base` at `/private/tmp/agentos-smoke-mooa18rv-yvxl6e/a/shared-base`
- `shared-base-9c64e76b` at `/private/tmp/agentos-smoke-mooa18rv-yvxl6e/b/shared-base`
- Additional agent `smoke-extra-mooa18rv-yvxl6e`

## Fixed Issues

### Native WS Auth Discovery Diagnostic

Reproduction:

- Run the native WS client against a healthy local Gateway without providing a real token/password.
- OpenClaw config returned `gateway.auth.token` as `__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__`.
- Before this pass, the Gateway closed the socket before AgentOS resolved the handshake credentials, so diagnostics reported the issue as `unreachable`.

Root cause:

- `NativeWsOpenClawGatewayClient.callNative` opened the WebSocket before resolving connect params and detecting redacted config secrets.

Fix:

- Native WS connect params are now built before opening the socket.
- Redacted OpenClaw secrets are classified as `auth` diagnostics before any native frame can be sent.
- Existing CLI fallback behavior is unchanged.

Tests:

- Updated the redacted-secret native WS test to assert the `auth` diagnostic kind.

### Workspace Id Collision

Reproduction:

- Create two workspaces with different parent folders but the same basename.
- Before this pass, both paths resolved to the same basename-derived workspace id.

Root cause:

- Workspace ids were normalized from only `path.basename(workspacePath)`, so different paths with the same basename collided.

Fix:

- Added contextual workspace id resolution in `lib/openclaw/domains/workspace-id.ts`.
- Non-colliding workspaces keep the existing slug id.
- Colliding workspaces keep the first observed slug id and disambiguate later same-basename paths with a short path hash.
- Legacy `workspace:<hash>` aliases remain accepted.
- Mission-control snapshots, workspace service responses, agent workspace resolution, and runtime normalization now use the shared id resolver where context is available.

Tests:

- Added workspace id resolver coverage for same-basename paths and legacy aliases.

### Gateway Remote URL Not Reflected In Snapshot

Reproduction:

- `PATCH /api/settings/gateway` with `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` returned success.
- The returned snapshot still had `configuredGatewayUrl: null`.

Root cause:

- Settings mutations wrote `gateway.remote.url` through the adapter, but mission-control snapshot loading was not reading that config path back into diagnostics.

Fix:

- Mission-control snapshot loading now reads `gateway.remote.url` through `OpenClawAdapter.getConfig`.
- The value is normalized into `snapshot.diagnostics.configuredGatewayUrl`.
- Clear still returns `configuredGatewayUrl: null`.

Verification:

- Live API recheck returned `configured: "ws://127.0.0.1:18789"` after set and `configured: null` after clear.

## Notes

- The smoke probe initially marked `gatewayUrl: "not-a-url"` as invalid, but the current product intentionally accepts bare host shorthand and normalizes it to `ws://...`. The true invalid-protocol case `http://example.com` correctly returns 400.
- Gateway stop returned a stable API response and then the local gateway health recovered. This appears to be current local gateway/probe behavior rather than a crash.
- Native WS scope is Gateway-first for supported read/probe workflows, config snapshot mutation, and generic RPC, with CLI fallback preserved for failures and unsupported agent mutation/provisioning/streaming workflows.
- In the current local environment, OpenClaw returns `gateway.auth.token` as a redacted config value to AgentOS. Native WS no longer sends that placeholder; it records an auth diagnostic and uses CLI fallback unless a real token/password is provided through env or explicit client options.
- CLI fallback remains required and was validated through a forced-env snapshot load.

## Final Verification

Final verification from this pass:

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `pnpm lint`: passed.
- `pnpm test`: passed, 105 tests.
- `pnpm build`: passed when rerun outside the sandbox after a sandbox-only Turbopack `Operation not permitted` failure.
- `node scripts/openclaw-runtime-smoke.mjs`: passed when rerun outside the sandbox. Latest run: gateway health/status PASS with `issues=6`, model status PASS, agents list PASS, sessions/recent activity PASS, agent preflight PASS, CLI fallback snapshot PASS. The sandboxed attempt failed because Node fetch to localhost returned `EPERM`/`fetch failed`.

2026-05-03 production-readiness verification:

- `pnpm test tests/openclaw-native-ws-gateway-client.test.ts`: passed, 14 tests.
- `pnpm test tests/openclaw-adapter.test.ts tests/openclaw-boundary-safety.test.ts tests/openclaw-import-guard.test.ts`: passed, 12 tests.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `pnpm lint`: passed.
- `pnpm test`: passed, 105 tests.
- `pnpm build`: sandboxed run failed with the known Turbopack worker/port `Operation not permitted` error; rerun outside the sandbox passed.
- `node scripts/openclaw-runtime-smoke.mjs`: sandboxed localhost fetch failed; rerun outside the sandbox passed all checks.
- Real agent chat stream through `/api/agents/main/chat`: passed and the resulting session was visible in `/api/snapshot?force=true`.
- Critical CLI-backed migration review added a `channels.status` Gateway-first adapter/client path and expanded the runtime smoke script with channel/provider status and fallback diagnostic checks.

## Remaining Risks

- Native WS cannot complete a successful authenticated handshake in this environment until a real Gateway token/password is supplied through env or explicit client options. Without that, Gateway-first attempts intentionally fall back to CLI with auth diagnostics.
- Real mission completion was not rerun in the 2026-05-03 validation pass.
- Real external provider provisioning requires valid provider credentials and target accounts.
- Destructive cleanup/delete flows still need explicit confirmation before execution.
- A full UI wizard-driven workspace create flow should be manually smoke-tested in a clean session before a demo.
- The full test suite still contains several slow missing-state characterization tests. They passed, but they make CI feedback slower.
